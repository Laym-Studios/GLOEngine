# Libraries

This game engine's primary programming language is going to be C++, and the framework the engine is going to use is going to be OpenGL, which is easy but is not that great performance-wise. This is fine though because I don't know much about Game Engine Creating.

This engine also uses ImGUI for the engine's Graphical User Interface, this is a very flexible libary which many people and software use such as reshade.

# Custom Language

Anyway, I want to talk about the custom language I'm planning to make for custom scripts in the game engine. This language will be responsible for every game script in the engine, I will also need to figure out how to link the engine to the language and vice versa. I'm planning for this language to be similar to C# since I am very familiar with it.
